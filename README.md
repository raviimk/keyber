# [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) is not (just) a typing test

It's the smartest way to learn touch typing and improve your typing speed.
On the surface, it looks pretty simple: it shows you a piece of text, and you type it out.
But the devil is in the details — keybr.com offers a few unique features:

* keybr.com tracks every single keystroke and computes statistics for each individual key.
* It automatically generates lessons that focus on your weakest keys.
* You can set your own target typing speed, and it tracks your progress toward that goal.
* It starts with a small set of the most frequent letters in your language.
* More letters are added once you reach the target speed with the current ones.
* It can even predict how many more lessons you will need to complete to reach your target speed.
* It provides a beautiful profile page with detailed graphs showing your learning progress.
* It offers plenty of modes and configuration options.
